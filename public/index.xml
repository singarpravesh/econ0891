4.1 Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals for a Single CoefficientIntroduction
Like all estimators, the OLS estimator has sampling uncertainty because its value differs from one sample to the next.This chapter presents methods for quantifying the sampling uncertainty of the OLS estimator through the use of standard errors, statistical hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals.</description>
